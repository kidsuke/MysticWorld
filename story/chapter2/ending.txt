Thank you for saving us from the eruption. We are really grateful for what you did. Please keep this as our appreciation.

By the way, I heard that the Mystic King is coming back. I saw what you did to that FIRE monsters on the top of the Volcano.
I know you are the one who can save us once again. Please help us!
