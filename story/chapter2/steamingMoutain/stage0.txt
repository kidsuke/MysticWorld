Yes, this place is famous for its temperature and all hot springs. There is a town down of the Volcano, 
you can see the shrine in the south of this place. Up to the hill is the beatiful Steaming Pool where people can soak their body for meditation.
The Healing Center is located near the beach, and in the north of the center is a Cave with a Rock Tower nearby.
Where would you like to go?
