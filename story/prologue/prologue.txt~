Oh...oh..Where am I? What is this place?

Calm down and look around.
I realize this is actually a very beautiful valley with so green grass and colorful flowers.
With sun shinning above, this place looks like heaven.
Am I dreaming? Oh shootttt, I am dead? Arggg, those teenagers killed me?
I am still young... I should not rescue dat boy then... Oh, wait! There is something over there.

It looks like a fluffy creature.

It seems that this creature is sleeping. What should I do?

In front of me there are roads with different signs:
The first road seems rough and can hardly be walked on foot. It has a rugged ground fulled with rocks and stones.
The second road seems ambiguous as it is covered by a solid wall of mist. I cannot guess where what lies ahead.
The third road is also not easy at all since there are a lot of strong whirlwinds that will slow me down.
Oh! There is a rope bridge leading to large old cottage on the fourth road.
What road should I choose? (1, 2, 3, 4)

I run as fast as I can if this is the last day of my life.
That monster is still after me.
T keep running, running without knowing where I am heading to.
Is that...?
BAMMMMMMMMMMMM
