Someone needs help. Let's go!
Your enemy has appeard. In our world, we fight monsters by solving puzzles and questions.
Depending on the level of the monster, the number of chances to try varies from 1 to many.
For example, if the monster is at level 1, you only have 1 chance
If you fail, the monster will escape and I will lose health
Succeeding in defeat monsters is important. Some missions or bosses require an amount of monsters that you have to defeat
Now, let's try with this one!

(player)
Are you ok?
