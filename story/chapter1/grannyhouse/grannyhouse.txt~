I wake up in a strange place, again. But this time, it  is more comfortable as I'm lying on a bed.
With the dead still hurts, the last thing I remember is crashing into something when being chased by a monster.
Some one has bandaged my wound.
Old dusty attic appears in front of me that at first thought it was the one in my house.
While intending to run for mom,  I realize this place is a little bit different.

Upon my head is a picture.
There are a table, a bookshelf  as well as a lot of boxes on the right.
Besides me lie a shield and a sword, which I know for sure never exist in my house.
At the end of the room is a small circle window. And next to it is the staircase.

A very good smell comes from this way.
Downstairs, an old woman is busy cooking while something, literally SOMETHING, is eating deliciously.
[Old Woman]
Oh you're awake my dear
[Player]
Uh..h..Y..es..Whe..re a..m...I?
[Old Woman]
Home, young man. Come here! You must be hungry.
(I slowly go to the table and sit down. However, the THING still scares me.)
[Old Woman]
Oh! It's yourmys. He saved you from that monster. You should not go there alone.
[Player]
He?????
(mystic)
What's your problem? Never seen a fabulous, awsome, brave, strong Mystic bef...
[Old Woman]
Haha not again yourmys. Just ignore it dear. He always blabber about himself.
I don't know what is happening, whether I'm dreaming or not. Mystic? She seems to be familiar with it.
[Old Woman]
What's your name? By the way, just call me Granny.
Enter your name:

[Granny]
Ok player, you seem to come from far away and may be strange to this place. Finish the meal yourmys will show you around.

[Granny]
Oh! Done? Take this bag with you.

[Granny]
Ok! You're good to go now. Have fun my dear!
