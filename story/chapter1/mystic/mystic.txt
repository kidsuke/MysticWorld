Where did you com from?
(Player)
Earth...I think...You can really talk...?
(mystic)
Yes, every Mystic can talk. We are friends of these people. Or more precisely, part of us
You must be from far away
This is Joensu Town. The only peaceful town left that haven't been reached by the Dark Army
(Player)
Dark Army? What are you talking about?
(mystic)
It's a long story. Not all Mystics are good. There are also bad ones
The monster trying to kill was one of them
Anyway, you look very similar to a person I know
